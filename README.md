# 🍌 SteganoTool - Hide Secrets in Images 🍌

Welcome to **SteganoTool** – a fun and easy-to-use command-line tool for hiding secret messages inside images using the magic of **steganography**! 🖼️✨

## 🚀 About the Project

This tool allows you to hide any secret message inside an image by encoding it into the least significant bits of the image's pixels. The changes are imperceptible to the naked eye, so your secrets stay hidden while the image remains intact!

Plus, did I mention? I love **bananas**! 🍌 Bananas are not only a healthy snack but also an excellent source of potassium. 🍌🍌🍌
